# Make-x-Chat-GPT-for-AI-Bot-Bug-Reporting
Looking to see if this is possible and if someone can set up this automation for one of my bots, then teach me or screen record how to duplicate for my other bots.

My problem: I've launched 5 ai bots and I want an automated way to report on bugs, errors, or confused leads.

My thought:
- create an automation that plots every message from the bot and lead into a sheet line by line
- Add a GPT in the automation to review and assess for bugs and assign a error level (critical, medium, low priority)
- Send me an sms hourly/certain cadence so I can review the errors and jump in where needed

The alternative I have right now is getting sent an email and SMS when a lead doesn't reply after an hour for me to manually check for errors, etc.
===========
To implement the automation you're describing, we can break it down into several steps. The general flow for this automation would be:

    Log every message from the bot and lead into a sheet (Google Sheets or database).
    Use GPT-3 or GPT-4 to assess the content of each message for possible bugs or confusion (using natural language processing for context understanding).
    Assign an error level (critical, medium, low priority) based on the analysis.
    Send automated reports via SMS to you on a predefined schedule (hourly, etc.).

This can be implemented using a combination of Python, Google Sheets API, Twilio (for SMS), and OpenAI's API (for GPT analysis).
Key Components:

    Google Sheets API to store bot-lead conversation logs.
    OpenAI's GPT for error detection and prioritization.
    Twilio API for sending SMS notifications.
    Python Scheduler (like schedule or APScheduler) to trigger automated processes.

Step-by-Step Code Implementation:

    Set up Google Sheets API: You need to authenticate with Google Sheets API, and then create a Google Sheet to log all messages. To authenticate, you’ll need to enable the Google Sheets API in your Google Developer Console and download the credentials.

    Log Messages to Google Sheets: Here’s how you can log each bot-lead interaction to Google Sheets.

import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials
import time

# Setup Google Sheets API
def authenticate_google_sheets():
    scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
    creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('path_to_your_credentials.json', scope)
    client = gspread.authorize(creds)
    return client.open("Bot Lead Conversation Log").sheet1

# Log each message
def log_message(sheet, bot_message, lead_message):
    timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    sheet.append_row([timestamp, bot_message, lead_message])

# Example of logging messages
sheet = authenticate_google_sheets()
log_message(sheet, "Bot: How can I assist you?", "Lead: I need help with product X.")

    GPT Analysis for Error Detection: Use OpenAI's API (GPT-3 or GPT-4) to assess the conversation and determine if there are any issues in the bot's responses. You can assess if the bot's reply is appropriate, leading, or confusing based on the lead's query.

import openai

# Authenticate with OpenAI
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

def analyze_message(bot_message, lead_message):
    prompt = f"""
    Given the following conversation between a bot and a lead, please identify if there are any issues or confusion in the conversation.
    If there are errors or confusion, assign an error level (critical, medium, low).
    Bot: {bot_message}
    Lead: {lead_message}
    Error Analysis:
    """

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Can use GPT-4 engine if available
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example of analyzing a conversation
bot_message = "How can I help you today?"
lead_message = "I don't understand what this product does."
error_analysis = analyze_message(bot_message, lead_message)
print(error_analysis)

    Send SMS Notifications: Use Twilio to send SMS alerts whenever an issue is detected based on the GPT error analysis.

from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio API credentials
twilio_account_sid = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
twilio_auth_token = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
twilio_phone_number = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
my_phone_number = 'your_phone_number'

def send_sms(message):
    client = Client(twilio_account_sid, twilio_auth_token)
    client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_=twilio_phone_number,
        to=my_phone_number
    )

# Example of sending an SMS alert
send_sms("Critical error detected in bot interaction: Lead is confused. Review immediately.")

    Scheduling the Automation: Using the schedule library, you can create a recurring task to check for new bot-lead messages, analyze the conversation for issues, and send you the SMS notification at a specific interval (e.g., every hour).

import schedule
import time

def automated_task():
    # Assuming 'sheet' is already authenticated and ready to use
    messages = sheet.get_all_records()  # Get all logged messages from Google Sheet

    for message in messages:
        bot_message = message['bot_message']
        lead_message = message['lead_message']
        
        error_analysis = analyze_message(bot_message, lead_message)

        if "critical" in error_analysis.lower():
            send_sms(f"Critical issue found: {error_analysis}")
        elif "medium" in error_analysis.lower():
            send_sms(f"Medium priority issue: {error_analysis}")
        elif "low" in error_analysis.lower():
            send_sms(f"Low priority issue: {error_analysis}")
    
# Schedule the task to run every hour
schedule.every(1).hours.do(automated_task)

# Keep running the scheduled task
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)

Putting It All Together:

    Google Sheets: Logs every bot-lead interaction.
    GPT-3/4: Analyzes the bot’s response and the lead’s message for issues or confusion.
    Twilio: Sends SMS alerts about any issues found based on the analysis.
    Scheduler: Automatically checks every hour, but this can be adjusted.

Setup Instructions:

    Google Sheets:
        Create a Google Sheet with columns: Timestamp, Bot Message, Lead Message.
        Authenticate using Google Sheets API and log messages.

    OpenAI GPT:
        Set up an OpenAI API key and ensure you have access to GPT-3 or GPT-4.

    Twilio:
        Set up a Twilio account and get your account SID, auth token, and phone number.

    Scheduling:
        The schedule library will run your automated_task() function every hour and send alerts based on error analysis.

Next Steps:

    Duplicate for Other Bots: To handle multiple bots, you can expand the Google Sheets logging and analysis system to differentiate between each bot's interaction. For example, you can have different sheets or columns for each bot.
    Monitor Results: Make sure that all the automated tasks are running correctly, and adjust the prompt or error detection logic as necessary.

This automation should provide you with a powerful tool to monitor bot performance and intervene whenever necessary based on AI-driven error detection and priority assignment.
